      <h1> <span class="code">NAND</span> and <span class="code">AND</span></h1>
      <hr>

      <p><span class="code">NAND</span> and <span class="code">AND</span> are two logic gates that go hand in hand. It's very easy to understand <span class="code">NAND</span> once you understand <span class="code">AND</span>, so we'll start with the latter.</p>

      <h3>The <span class="code">AND</span> Gate- Exactly What You'd Think</h3>

      <p>The first real gate- that is, a gate with two inputs- that we'll be learning about is the <span class="code">AND</span> gate.</p>

      <p>The easiest way to understand this gate is to think of what it implies in English. If a gate has two boolean inputs, labelled <span class="mono">1</span> and <span class="mono">2</span>, then in order for the gate to produce <span class="mono">TRUE</span> as an output, both <span class="mono">1</span> <span class="code">AND</span> <span class="mono">2</span> have to be <span class="mono">TRUE</span></p>

      <p>Below is the diagram and truth table for an <span class="code">AND</span> gate.</p>

      <img src="img/u2c2-1.png" alt="preset" class="inlinepic-big">

      <p>Note that unless the first input <strong>and</strong> the second input are on, the gate will not produce a positive output.</p>

      <p>Here's what this gate would look like in Minecraft. Here, we make use of a more clever arrangement of Redstone and torches that wouldn't seem immediately apparent.</p>

      <h3>The <span class="code">NAND</span> Gate- <span class="code">AND</span>'s Evil Twin</h3>

      <p>Simply put, in order to create a <span class="code">NAND</span> gate, all we have to do is place an inverter in front of an <span class="code">AND</span> gate.</p>

      <p>You may be wondering- if this gate is just a combination of the last two gates we learned, why bother learning it? It turns out that the <span class="code">NAND</span> gate (along with the <span class="code">NOR</span> gate that we'll see later) possess a special property that we'll explore later.</p>

      <p>For now, just remember, an inverter in front of an <span class="code">AND</span> gate should do the trick. Below, you'll find the diagram, truth table, and Minecraft schematic.</p>
