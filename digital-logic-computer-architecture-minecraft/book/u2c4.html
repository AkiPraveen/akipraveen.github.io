      <h1> <span class="code">XOR</span>- the 'Exclusive' Or</h1>
      <hr>

      <p>The 'Exclusive' <span class="code">OR</span>, or <span class="code">XOR</span>, is a gate that essentially adds one extra limitation to the <span class="code">OR</span> gate.</p>

      <p>The caveat is this. For an <span class="code">XOR</span> gate to produce an output of 'on', one of the two inputs has to be on, but not both. Alternatively, one can say that both the inputs must hold opposite states.</p>

      <p>For more clarity, take a look at the truth table below.</p>

      <img src="img/u2c4-1.png" alt="preset" class="inlinepic-big">

      <p>We can see that the <span class="code">XOR</span> gate returns a value of 'True' when the inputs are opposites, but it returns a value of 'False' when the inputs are identical.</p>

      <p>The Minecraft schematic for this particular gate is a little more complex, but you can see that it's been cleverly shrunken down to make full use of redstone mechanics. You'll find it below.</p>

      <div class="schematic">
        <iframe name="gate" src="https://cubical.xyz/project/j9yD" frameborder="0" class="mc-schematic"></iframe>
        <div class="schematic-desc">
            click to focus, press esc to exit. powered by cubical  <span style="float:right;"> click 'refresh' if the screen is black. <button class="rel" onclick="var ifr=document.getElementsByName('gate')[0]; ifr.src=ifr.src;">[refresh]</button></span>
        </div>
      </div>

      <br>

      <p>I highly recommend building this and messing around with it, just to get a feel for building circuits in redstone whose function aren't immediately apparent.</p>

      <p>There is an inverted counterpart, or <strong>logical complement</strong> to this gate known as the <span class="code">XNOR</span>, but it isn't as useful to us as <span class="code">NOR</span> or <span class="code">NAND</span> can be. As such we won't be covering it in this course. The next section talks a little more about logical complements.</p>
